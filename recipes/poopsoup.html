        <h2>Busted Magic Draft, a.k.a. Poop Soup</h2>
        <img src="../images/poop.jpg" alt="Not Actual Poop">
        <h4>What starts with the best of intentions quickly snowballs out of control
            as your colors dry up. Scrapping for D-level playables and awash with regret
            and confusion, the resultant concoction can best be described as "Poop Soup".
        </h4>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1500 gems</li>
                <li>Inflated ego</li>
                <li>Rudimentary knowledge of format draft signals</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin the draft.</li>
                <li>Notice a seemingly open lane about 3 to 5 picks in.</li>
                <li>Commit to that lane. Be sure to get your hopes up about the potential.</li>
                <li>Around pick 10, you should start to feel the dread rising as the final picks yield nothing playable.</li>
                <li>Reaffirm your mental commitment to making the plan work.</li>
                <li>Open crap in Pack 2.</li>
                <p><strong>Try this for a neat twist:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hard pivot after opening an off color bomb in pack 2!</li>
                <p></p>
            </ul>
                <li>Force your way into a second color because you expect to see it in Pack 3.</li>
                <li>Observe the great cards getting passed to you in two colors you are not playing.</li>
                <li>Wallow in self pity as the plan utterly fails to materialize.</li>
                <li>Consider dropping without playing a game.</li>
                <li>Play the games, because value.</li>
                <li>Lose the games.</li>
            </ol>
